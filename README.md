# language detection machine learning

In this project, I pulled text data from European Parliament Proceedings in 21 languages. Using Scikit-Learn, I transformed the raw text into a numerical feature matrix, and trained a Multinomial naive bayes probability model to classify input language with greater than 98% accuracy.
